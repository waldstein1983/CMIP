This package contains M-type problems for uncapacitated facility 
location. There are 37 files in the package:

In /M/O
MO1 - MO5		O-type problems
MO1.opt - MO5.opt	optimal solutions

In /M/P
MP1 - MP5		P-type problems
MP1.opt - MP5.opt	optimal solutions

In /M/Q
MQ1 - MQ5		Q-type problems
MQ1.bub - MQ5.bub	best found solutions

In /M/R
MR1 - MR5		R-type problems
MR1.bub - MR5.bub	best found solutions

In /M/S, /M/T
MS1, MT1		S- and T-type problems
MS1.bub, MT1.bub	best found solutions

The file structure is as follows:
On the first line there are the the number of facilities and cities.
Then there are two sections. In the first section of the file we have
on each line the following data for one facility
[capacity] [opening cost] 
In the second section we have for each city data in the following form:
[demand of city] [cost connect. to facility 1] ... [cost connect. to facility n]

The solutions are denoted in the following form. For each city there is the 
number of the facility which the city is connected to in the solution. Here 
the first number is for the first city, the second number for the second 
city and so on. The cities are ordered according to their data in the 
problem file.
