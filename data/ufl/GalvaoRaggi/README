This package contains Galvão-Raggi-type problems for uncapacitated facility 
location. There are 100 files in the package:

In each directory there are 20 files. 10 files containing the problem
instances and 10 files with an optimal solution to each problem.
There are 5 directories with different problem sizes:

50
70
100
150
200

The problem file structure is as follows:
On the first line there is the filename, and on the second line the number of 
facilities, cities and a 0. 
Then on each line we have the data for one of the facilities:
[number] [opening cost] [cost of connect. city 1] ... [cost of connect. city m]

The optimal solutions are denoted in the following form. For each city there
is the number of the facility which the city is connected to in the optimal
solution. Here the first number is for the first city, the second number for
the second city and so on. The cities are ordered according to their 
connection costs in the problem file.
